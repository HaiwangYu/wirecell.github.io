Out with ~cout~ and its an error to use ~cerr~!

{{{TEASER_END}}}

A user (or devloper) may sometimes want a silent job that emits no
logging messages and in other cases a very verbose one.  When
verbosity is desired it is almost always for a specific part of the
code and not everywhere.  Sometimes the user wants to write logging to
file, sometimes to stdout and sometimes to stderr.  It is not uncommon
for uncontrolled verbose logging to dominate job output and lead to
real practical problems.

When the developer uses ~cout~ and ~cerr~ it leaves the user with no
control over these messages.  Recently WCT has added a logging system
and use of ~cout~ and ~cerr~ is strongly discouraged, especially in
library code.

The WCT logging system is a thin layer on top of [[https://github.com/gabime/spdlog][spdlog]].  The ~spdlog~
package was chosen after a survey of likely candidates.  It was chosen
for some of the following reasons:

- it is fast and thread safe
- a header-only package and includes the nice ~fmt~ sub package
- provides multiple loggers with individual levels
- fairly undemanding of the code that uses it
- may be integrated into application-level logging

The fact that ~spdlog~ is provided as a header-only library means that
it can and has been added directly into WCT code so that the user need
not install another external package.

The multiple logger feature is used to define a loosely coupled set of
loggers identified by name.  Any given logger should be used in
whatever code might be considered associated.  The use of given logger
may span packages.  For example, the *glue* logger is used in all
"simple" DFP components that don't do anything special but
housekeeping (eg, fanout/fanin type nodes).  One can then turn up or
down the log levels for these separate from say *sigproc* or *img*
loggers.

As WCT is a toolkit meant to be embedded in larger frameworks or
applications and as these tend to provide their own logging systems,
it is important to provide a mechanism by which WCT logging may be
integrated.  The ~spdlog~ package allows for new message "sinks" to be
developed.  This provides the a logging vector from WCT logging to
application or framework logging.  Thus, a ~spdlog~ sink can be
developed which simply forwards every message it is given to the app
logging system.
