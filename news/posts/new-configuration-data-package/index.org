Today a new package joins the WCT family.  

https://github.com/WireCell/wire-cell-data

This collects the "configuration data" files which are needed for
input to WCT.  These are generally compressed JSON files which have
been converted to a WCT standard format from a variety of sources.
The data includes wire geometry, field response, noise spectra and a
couple initial deposition files.  

Having this repository makes it easier for users to prepare to run
WCT.  At some point in the future this package may be installed along
with the code, but for now, users need to clone this repo.  For WCT to
locate these files the produced directory needs to be added to the
user's =WIRECELL_PATH= environment variable.

See the [[https://github.com/WireCell/wire-cell-data/blob/master/README.org][README]] file for details including a summary of the files
available and commands to remake these files from their upstream
sources.

Previously this data was kept online [[http://www.phy.bnl.gov/~bviren/tmp/wctsim/wct-dev/share/wirecell/data/][in a directory]] dump.  That's
still there for now.  It includes some files not added to GitHub.  In
particular the "upstream" data from which the JSON files are converted
(eg, the Garfield output) can be found.  And next door to that
directory is a [[http://www.phy.bnl.gov/~bviren/tmp/wctsim/wct-dev/share/wirecell/plots/][plot dump directory]] which contains some diagnostic
plots related to the conversion of these files which may be useful for
experts to browse.
