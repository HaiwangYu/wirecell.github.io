Today sees some long needed cleanups in how we build WCT and WCP and their externals.  In particular:

- [[http://jsonnet.org/][Jsonnet]], as previously announced is now *required* by WCT has a build package added to [[https://github.com/WireCell/wire-cell-spack/blob/master/repo/packages/jsonnet/package.py][wire-cell-spack]]. 
- A [[http://www.phy.bnl.gov/~bviren/wire-cell-spack-mirror/][source mirror]] is now available in case you have trouble getting any required dependencies.  The Spack build will use this mirror automatically after being configured as shown in [[https://github.com/WireCell/wire-cell-spack/blob/master/README.org#failure-to-download-a-package-source][the README]] file.
- Besides the tip of the =master= branch, specific releases starting with 0.5.2 of WCT can now be installed with Spack.
- The WCP and its dependencies can now be built using wire-cell-spack.  WCP uses a subset of the packages that WCT requires and the two can be installed side-by-side sharing these packages.
- See also [[https://github.com/WireCell/wire-cell-spack/blob/master/README.org#using-spack-views][this section of the README]] for recommended way to develop either WCP or WCT code against Spack-built dependencies.
- The cursed XData package is removed from both WCP and WCT.
