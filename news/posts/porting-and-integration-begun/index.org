Xin concluded an intense effort to port the prototype [[https://github.com/WireCell/wire-cell-sigproc][signal processing code into the toolkit]].

With hints from Lynn Garren (FNAL) a [[https://github.com/brettviren/larwirecell/blob/feature/integration/larwirecell/integration.org#set-larwirecell-environment][method]] to set up an environment where both WCT and its LArSoft integration package (=larwirecell=) can be simultaneously developed.
